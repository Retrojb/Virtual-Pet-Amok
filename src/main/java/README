Virtual Pet Java Consule Application
@Created by: John Baltes
@We Can {CODE} IT Columbus OH
2018:

Using abstract class to gain an understanding for how object orientented programming works

Requirements:
have 2 different types of animal groups (organic and Robotic) 
have 2 different types of animals (cats and dogs) 
have waster effect the health of the animals(organic only)
be able to walk all animals at once
robot pets can not be feed or watered
instead have to be oiled and maintained
run a game tick that deducts stats from animals each time through the loop

Generals of the code:

Virtual Pets: 
	PET_ENERGY: is the variable that will be used when for hunger in organic pets, while being
	used as charge in the robotic pets. 
	PET_THIRST: is the variable that will be used for thirst in the organic pet, while being
	used as oiling in the robotic pet class.

	game tick: the intervals of each action in the game will change the status of a pets by + / - 10 pts
	upon ac5tion selection. While each action has a effect on the pets as a whole group through the tick method.
	stats will be deducted each turn through by -5. in turn this makes the game more difficult to max out all stats
	for all animals at any given time.
	
Organic Pets:
	Organic pets create waste that needs top be cleaned up, waste is gained by 5 per tick. The user can only clean
	one animal types waste at a time, but it rest the waste to zero by subtacting waste from waste (hacky, i know).
		organic pets poop, and when you clean one you clean them all so that the logic behind that decisions. \
	
		Organic Dog and Cat rules:	
			organic dogs required to be caged as they will chew up your shoes and destroy your keyboard. 
			organic cats can roam freely, as it is almost impossible to cage a cat. \
			organic dogs must be walked, while organic cats require a suffiecent amount of cat shine naps. 

Robotic Pets:
	require being oiled and maintained which is comporable to feeding and giving the organic pets water, 
	robotic pets require less attention sense they are robots and don't have emotional needs like my cat currently does. 
 
Virtual Pet Shelter:
	handles all of the paper work process of adopting out and taking in animals
	storing the animals information since this shelter doesn't believe in data basing its information, which would make
	this entire ordeal so much easier. 
	
I hope you have enjoyed the README now go play with some animals, or continue reading to see what issues the app 
is currently having and future plans for the app, once i have finished this boot camp, or have free time to play 
around again.
